# protoraft
A Raft prototype for learning purpose, which implements core features of Raft as below:

- [x] Leader Election
- [x] Log Replication
- [x] Support for Log Compaction 
- [ ] Support for Cluster Membership Changes

This implementation passed the test cases of MIT 6.824 Lab 2/3/4 more than 300 times, which means there should be no serious bug. Of course it's not for production.
