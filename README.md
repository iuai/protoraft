# Protoraft
Protoraft is a simple Raft implementation for learning purpose, which covers core features of Raft as below:

- [x] Leader Election
- [x] Log Replication
- [x] Support for Log Compaction 
- [ ] Support for Cluster Membership Changes

This implementation passed the test cases more than 300 times so there should be no serious bug. Of course, it's not for production and poorly optimized.
