# protoraft
A Raft prototype for learning purpose, which implements core features of Raft as below:

- [x] Leader Election
- [x] Log Replication
- [x] Support for Log Compaction 
- [ ] Support for Cluster Membership Changes

This implementation passed the test cases more than 300 times so there should be no serious bug. Of course it's not for production.
